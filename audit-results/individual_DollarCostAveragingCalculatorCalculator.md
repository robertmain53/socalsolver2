# Calculator Audit Report: Dollar Cost Averaging Calculator Calculator

**Overall Score: 7.4/10**
**Audit Date:** 8/11/2025

## Executive Summary

âœ… **GOOD** - Solid calculator with minor areas for improvement to reach enterprise level.

## Formula Analysis (Score: 6/10)

### Mathematical Correctness: 6/10
### Implementation Quality: 7/10
### Formula Complexity: low

**Detected Issues:**
- The formula for estimated returns does not account for periodic contributions. It calculates the return on the total investment as if it were invested as a lump sum at the beginning. This is not how dollar-cost averaging works.
- The application does not handle large numbers well.  For example, with large inputs, the estimated returns and total value can become Infinity.
- Input validation only checks for positive values. It should also check for excessively large values that could cause overflows or other issues.
- No check for valid percentage inputs (e.g., values over 100% are accepted for return rate).

**Recommendations:**
- Use a more accurate formula for dollar-cost averaging that accounts for the timing of the regular investments.  The future value of a series formula would be appropriate.
- Implement better handling of large numbers. This could involve using libraries that support arbitrary precision or scaling the calculations appropriately.
- Add input validation to prevent excessively large values and non-sensical percentage values.
- Consider adding error handling for the PDF export functionality to provide more informative error messages to the user.

## UX Analysis

### Usability: 8/10
### Accessibility: 7/10  
### Responsive Design: 8/10
### Professional UI: 8/10

**UX Issues:**
- L'errore di input non Ã¨ visualizzato in modo prominente per l'utente.
- Manca un feedback visivo chiaro dopo il calcolo.

**Accessibility Violations:**
- Mancanza di ARIA labels per i campi di input.
- Non Ã¨ presente un messaggio di errore accessibile per gli screen reader.

## Competitive Analysis

**Category:** Default
**Current Metrics:**
- Inputs: 3 (Benchmark: 7)
- Outputs: 9 (Benchmark: 5)
- Complexity: 10/10 (Benchmark: 7/10)

**Competitive Position:**
- Inputs: below_benchmark
- Outputs: above_benchmark  
- Complexity: above_benchmark

**Strategic Recommendations:**
- Considera aggiungere 4 input per competere con benchmark settore
- Aggiungi ARIA labels per compliance WCAG 2.1

## Next Actions

ðŸ”´ **HIGH PRIORITY**: Review and fix mathematical formulas
ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Consider adding more input options to match competitor offerings
